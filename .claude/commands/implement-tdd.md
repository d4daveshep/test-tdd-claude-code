Implement the minimal code to make these tests pass: $ARGUMENTS

Requirements:

- Only write code that makes failing tests pass
- Start with the simplest possible implementation
- Run tests frequently - after every small change
- If a test fails, fix the code, don't change the test
- Show me test results after each iteration
- Stop when all tests are green

Implementation strategy:

1. Identify the simplest failing test
2. Write minimal code to make it pass
3. Run tests
4. Move to next failing test
5. Repeat until all tests pass

Avoid:

- Over-engineering
- Adding features not covered by tests
- Modifying tests to fit implementation
- Premature optimization
