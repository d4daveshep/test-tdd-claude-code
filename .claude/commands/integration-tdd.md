Create integration tests for: $ARGUMENTS

Focus on:

1. Testing interactions between components
2. Database operations (if applicable)
3. External API calls (with proper mocking)
4. File I/O operations
5. Configuration loading
6. Error handling across component boundaries

Structure:

- Use appropriate test fixtures for external dependencies
- Include setup/teardown for test data
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify side effects (database changes, file creation, etc.)
- Test transaction boundaries and rollbacks

Integration test naming: test*integration*[workflow_name]\_[scenario]

After creating tests:

1. Run them to see failures
2. Implement the integration points
3. Iterate until all integration tests pass
