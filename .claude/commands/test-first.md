Write comprehensive tests for: $ARGUMENTS

Instructions:

- This is the RED phase of TDD - write failing tests only
- Cover all expected behaviors, edge cases, and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
- Include docstrings explaining what each test validates
- Use appropriate test fixtures and setup/teardown
- **ABSOLUTELY NO implementation code - tests only**

After writing tests:

1. Run them to confirm they fail appropriately
2. Show me the test structure and failure output
3. Ask if I want to proceed to implementation phase

Test file naming: test*[module_name].py
Test method naming: test*[action]_[expected_result]_[conditions]
