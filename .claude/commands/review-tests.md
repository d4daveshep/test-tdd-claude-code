Review the test coverage and quality for: $ARGUMENTS

Analysis checklist:

- [ ] Do tests cover all public methods/functions?
- [ ] Are edge cases tested?
- [ ] Are error conditions tested?
- [ ] Are tests isolated (no dependencies between tests)?
- [ ] Are test names descriptive and clear?
- [ ] Is setup/teardown appropriate?
- [ ] Are assertions specific and meaningful?
- [ ] Is there any test duplication?
- [ ] Are mocks used appropriately (and sparingly)?

Provide:

1. Coverage analysis (run coverage tools if available)
2. List of missing test scenarios
3. Suggestions for test improvements
4. Identification of brittle or unclear tests

Generate additional test cases for any gaps found.
