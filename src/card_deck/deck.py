class Deck:

    A standard 52-card deck of playing cards.

    Represents a complete deck of playing cards with all standard suits and ranks.
    Each deck contains exactly 52 unique cards (13 ranks Ã— 4 suits).
    Cards are immutable and the deck provides defensive copies to maintain integrity.

    The deck is initialized with all standard playing cards:
    - Suits: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs
    - Ranks: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K

    Attributes:
        cards: A defensive copy of the deck's cards as a List[Card]

    Example:
        >>> deck = Deck()
        >>> len(deck)
        52
        >>> deck.cards[0].rank
